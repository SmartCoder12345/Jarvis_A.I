# Jarvis_A.I
I have created a Jarvis A.I using Python and you can feel free to use this at your own PC. 

Here is the docs about how to use it :- 
Introduction
------------
Let's start from start. First of all, What is Jarvis A.I ?
You all have seen the movie of Iron Man. There he had a virtual assistant named Jarvis.

Let me tell you a few things to make your mind clear.
1. This Jarvis is not scripted. (Meaning it can't only perform specific task.)
2. This Jarvis has it's own mind and have some artificial emotions.
3. This Jarvis is friendly.

Note: Jarvis - Trained AI Language Model

Please note that the virtual assistant, Jarvis, integrated into this system, is powered by an advanced AI language model. Jarvis has undergone extensive training using a cutting-edge deep learning technique known as GPT-3.5 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3.5). This training involved exposure to a vast corpus of diverse text data to develop its language understanding and generation capabilities.

It's important to understand that Jarvis operates based on its training and does not possess independent consciousness or self-awareness. It leverages its training to provide intelligent responses and assist users with various tasks within its programmed scope.

From where to start Jarvis A.I.?
--------------------------------
If you will have a look at the file explorer of Pycharm,  you will find a file named main.py. This file is the entry point of the Jarvis AI. Double click to open this file. You can run Your Jarvis A.I. by pressing the Run button (present upside the file explorer to the right corner).
But before you run the Jarvis A.I. you are requested to read this full docs first.

How Jarvis A.I. works?
----------------------
When you will run the Jarvis A.I. it will ask you to enter your name by using your keyboard and It greets you by name.
Now, Jarvis A.I. comes in action to help you. But first you have to learn about its Settings.
It's settings are as follows:
1. Allow Jarvis to Speak.
2. Save the questions answered by the Jarvis.
3. It will give my input using :- Microphone or Keyboard.
We will learn it one by one. But first you should know how to give your input.

How to give your input?
-----------------------
If you remember there was a setting like this :-
I will give my input using :- Microphone or Keyboard.
By default, this is set by using Microphone.

If it is set to microphone, It will print:-

Listening... -> At this Period, you have to give your query.
Recognising... -> At this Period, Jarvis will try to understand your query.

Now, if you said something like:- "Hello Jarvis". It will print:-
{your_name} said: Hello Jarvis
And it will take some action according to it.

Else, it will print:-
Sorry Sir, I couldn't listen to you. Please repeat again.
And it will relisten you.

If it is set to keyboard, It will print:-
Enter your command =>
And you have to enter your command.

Note :-
1. If you are using microphone, It will take some time to listen according to your microphone's quality and speed. But if you are using keyboard, It will take instant.
2. If you will on the setting "Allow Jarvis to Speak"(By default, it is on), It will also speak his words.

How to use Jarvis  A.I.?

Now, I will tell you how to use it productively.

You can use Jarvis A.I. in two ways.
1. Using answer the questions.
2. By chatting (You can still ask questions to him).

You can use this by simply adding a prefix 'answer' to your question.

Use - To answer any type of question. (No Limits - Power of A.I.)
-> IT will answer your question just like a question solving engine and it will save it in the prompts folder.

Now remember this setting -> Save the questions answered by the Jarvis.
This is ticked by default. It will save the questions answered by Jarvis in the prompts folder only if it is checked.

Merits :- You can access the solution of your question in the prompts folder anytime and anywhere.
